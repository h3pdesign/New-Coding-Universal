To configure and use **SharePoint Server 2016 SE** with **PowerShell**, including integration with **Power Automate**, **Managed Metadata Service (MMS)**, **Search**, **User Profile Service (UPS)**, **Office Online Server (OOS)**, **Secure Store**, and **IIS**, here's a structured guide based on best practices and Microsoft documentation [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-powershell) [2](https://www.sphammad.com/abcd-of-powershell-automating-sharepoint-2016-installation/) [3](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/connect-sharepoint-2016-with-powerapps-and-power/3b4ace2d-fda0-4c20-abb1-84b23dcfadf1):

### üîß **1. Initial Setup with PowerShell**

Start by launching the **SharePoint Management Shell** as Administrator. This shell is preloaded with SharePoint cmdlets.

#### Example: Create a new SharePoint farm

```powershell
New-SPConfigurationDatabase -DatabaseName "SP_Config" -DatabaseServer "SQLServerName" -AdministrationContentDatabaseName "SP_AdminContent" -Passphrase (ConvertTo-SecureString "YourPassphrase" -AsPlainText -Force) -FarmCredentials (Get-Credential)
```

---

### üîÑ **2. Power Automate Integration**

SharePoint 2016 is on-premises, so to use **Power Automate**, you need to:

- Set up a **Data Gateway** to bridge cloud services with on-premises data.
- Register your SharePoint 2016 site in **Power Automate** using the gateway.

> Note: Only limited triggers/actions are available for on-prem SharePoint in Power Automate [3](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/connect-sharepoint-2016-with-powerapps-and-power/3b4ace2d-fda0-4c20-abb1-84b23dcfadf1).

---

### üß† **3. Managed Metadata Service (MMS)**

To configure MMS via PowerShell:

```powershell
New-SPManagedMetadataServiceApplication -Name "Managed Metadata Service" -ApplicationPool "SharePoint Service App Pool" -DatabaseName "SP_MMS_DB"
New-SPManagedMetadataServiceApplicationProxy -Name "Managed Metadata Service Proxy" -ServiceApplication "Managed Metadata Service"
```

---

### üîç **4. Search Service Application**

```powershell
New-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication -Name "Search Service" -ApplicationPool "SharePoint Service App Pool" -DatabaseName "Search_DB"
New-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplicationProxy -Name "Search Proxy" -ServiceApplication "Search Service"
```

---

### üë§ **5. User Profile Service (UPS)**

UPS setup is more complex and includes:

- Creating the UPS service app
- Starting the **User Profile Synchronization Service**
- Configuring synchronization connections

```powershell
New-SPProfileServiceApplication -Name "User Profile Service" -ApplicationPool "SharePoint Service App Pool" -ProfileDBName "Profile_DB" -SocialDBName "Social_DB" -ProfileSyncDBName "Sync_DB"
```

---

### üìù **6. Office Online Server (OOS) Integration**

- Install and configure OOS separately.
- Use PowerShell to bind OOS to SharePoint:

```powershell
New-SPWOPIBinding -ServerName "oos.contoso.com"
Set-SPWOPIZone -Zone "internal-http"
```

---

### üîê **7. Secure Store Service**

```powershell
New-SPSecureStoreServiceApplication -Name "Secure Store Service" -ApplicationPool "SharePoint Service App Pool" -DatabaseName "SecureStore_DB"
New-SPSecureStoreServiceApplicationProxy -Name "Secure Store Proxy" -ServiceApplication "Secure Store Service"
```

---

### üåê **8. IIS Configuration**

While IIS is mostly managed via GUI, you can automate tasks like:

```powershell
Import-Module WebAdministration
Set-ItemProperty "IIS:\Sites\SharePoint - 80" -Name bindings -Value @{protocol="http";bindingInformation="*:80:"}
```

### ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

Would you like a **PowerShell script template** that automates the full setup of these services? I can generate one tailored to your environment (e.g., server names, service accounts, etc.).
